# Hello-World
I'm learning how to create a Respository on Github.com.

Hello, My name is Edy.I live in the United States in the state of Florida. I am trying to open an online store with WISH. A link on the quick start guide took me to Github.com. I currently have a store with Ebay. It was alot easier to seyt up my store on Ebay then on WISH'S API. Which i still don't know exactly what a API EVEN IS! Any help wpuld be greatly appreciated.
